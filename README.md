# Notes

### Home Page

* Recommend welcome block pictures to have something to separate - either a border or drop-shadow.
* In the template the pictures for activities are not links, but the document indicated the want for links. Happy to make them links, but wanted to make sure we're on the same page.
* There is a pop-out menu when you click on the hamburger icon on the right end of the main navigation. Do we want to ditch that?
